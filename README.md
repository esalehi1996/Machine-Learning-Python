# Machine-Learning-Python

Multiple machine learning projects have been implemented in this repository. Most of them are in Ipython Notebook format.

* The source files "RNN-GAN.ipynb" and "DCGAN_single_frame_gen.ipynb" respectively are implementations of a single frame generator based on DCGAN and an experimental video generator which does not work properly yet.

* The source files "CIFAR10_classifier.ipynb" and "MNIST_classifier.ipynb" respectively are implementations of a neural net based CIFAR10 classifier and SVM and Random forest based MNIST classifiers.

* The source file "sparse.ipynb" is the implementation of a sparce linear classifier of a very large dataset with massive feature size.

* The source file "QR.py" is the implementation of QR decomposition in python.
